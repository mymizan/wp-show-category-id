# WP SHOW CATEGORY ID
A simple plugin to show post category and WooCommerce product category IDs on category list page

By default, on category list and and WooCommerce product category list, IDs are not shown. Sometimes, you may need to get the IDs for say to include in a shortcode or somewhere else in WordPress. I have made this simple plugin to help achieve that.
