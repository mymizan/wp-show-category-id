# WP SHOW CATEGORY ID
A simple plugin that will apply a CSS stylesheet globally across all sites of a WordPress multi-site installation. 

There are many other CSS plugins which do the job better, but the goal here is simpsicity. As developers, we often need to apply small piece of CSS and a fancy plugin is an overkill for it. I wrote this plugin so that I can put small piece of CSS code that are unrelated to any plugin or themes, without having to install install a complex, bloated plugin. 

Hope you will find it useful.
